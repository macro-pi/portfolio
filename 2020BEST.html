                Our challenge was to design and build a robot to sample, identify, and separate individual cells, apply vaccines where needed to immunize uninfected cells, and autonomously collect cell samples. Specifically, we needed to complete the following tasks.
            </p>
            <ul class = 'int-bul'>
                <li>Collect cells on ground and on top and beneath isolation platforms.</li>
                <li>Transport and deposit cells in the Test Staging Area (TSA).</li>
                <li>Collect tested cells from the TSA and deliver them to isolation zones and the top of 6” and 12” isolation platforms.</li>
                <li>Hold, transport, and deliver vaccines to isolation zones and top of 6” or 12” isolation platforms.</li>
                <li>Hold, transport, and deliver super vaccine to top of 6” or 12” isolation platforms.</li>
                <li>Autonomously travel to predetermined grid zones, collect cells, and deliver them to the TSA.
                    This notebook will detail the process we used to develop our strategy, robot, and software.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class = 'intro-text' style = 'width: 120%; margin-left: 0;'><br/>We began by creating a design process to use throughout the development and construction of our robot. It was also used to design our strategy and software. It consisted of the following steps.

                <br/><br/><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Define Design Challenge:</strong>
                For each robot task, we created a set of criteria and constraints to clearly define a plan to achieve our strategic goals. The constraints were the limiting factors, such as competition rules, size, and weight limits. These were the same for each design challenge. The criteria were the features the component needed to possess, such as robustness, speed, a secure grip, or easy maneuverability.
                
                <br/><br/><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brainstorm Solutions:</strong>
                In order to proceed efficiently, team members were asked to research potential solutions by looking at industrial and commercial examples prior to meeting. They were also encouraged to imagine unusual or potentially impossible solutions. The goal of each brainstorming session was to generate as many ideas as possible, regardless of feasibility or legality. Therefore, the constraints were temporarily ignored so that every facet of the design challenge could be explored and possible solutions discovered. The sessions were designed to be fun and relaxed so members were not afraid to make a suggestion, no matter how unusual. Our hope was that strange ideas might inspire previously unconsidered ideas in other team members' minds. All team members participated, including the marketing and outreach departments, so we would maximize the number and range of ideas; and all had an equal vote in every step of the process. To accommodate our different schedules, the brainstorming process took place over two days via Zoom. After completion, the group analyzed the list and eliminated the ideas which clearly violated the constraints, were deemed unethical, or for which a concept demonstrator (potential design) could not be imagined.
                
                <br/><br/><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Analytical Evaluation of Initial Design Alternatives:</strong>
                For each remaining idea, concept demonstrators were explored through sketches and cardboard models before the team met again. At the next meeting, the ideas were placed into a series of decision matrices and mathematically analyzed based on the criteria defined earlier. For each criterion, a score of one to five was given, with one being the lowest. Each team member voted independently and the rounded averages of the scores were put into the decision matrix. The total for each concept was calculated and the ones with the highest scores were chosen to move on to the next phase. 
                
                <br/><br/><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Develop Solution:</strong>
                After an idea was chosen by the entire team, sub-teams under the direction of the captain were formed to develop a detailed plan listing every aspect of the design. Taken into consideration were the constraints and criteria developed during the first phase, the offensive and defensive strategies planned, as well as the functionality of the design in relation to the overall robot plan. Sketches were initially drawn by hand to formulate a basic design. Next, they were sketched and refined in Onshape, a cloud based CAD program which allowed modifications from team members in different locations due to COVID restrictions. Simulation was done in Onshape to test functionality interacting with field pieces. 
                
                <br/><br/><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Construct and Test Prototypes:</strong>
                Moving into the prototyping phase, the CAD sketches were often used to first construct models in paper and cardboard. These versions were quicker to make and saved materials so that the process could proceed more efficiently and economically. The prototypes and CAD sketches were refined and eventually manufactured out of the chosen materials for the final component. Manufacturing was done by the same team that designed the component to ensure adherence to specifications. Critical components were manufactured on a CNC mill, laser cutter, or router if possible, but access to the machines was limited due to COVID restrictions so most components were made with manual machines.
                <br/><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prototypes were tested and the data was analyzed by the strategy team to determine what improvements could be made as well as the validity of the design. The process was repeated and modifications were made until the design reached its desired form and accomplished the task as efficiently as possible.

                <br/><br/><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Analytical Evaluation of Final Design Alternatives:</strong>
If more than one prototype was completed, they were tested against each other and their scores were analyzed to determine the final design to be used on the robot.
